# Dogs Vs Cats(CNN Experimentation)
--------------------------------------
**Dataset**

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

---------------------------------------
**Description**

The original dataset from Kaggle contains 25000 training images. For experimentation purposes I have extracted 2000 images from the original dataset out of which 1000 images(each of Cats & Dogs) consists of Training data and 500(each of Cats & Dogs) images consists of Validation data.

-----------------------------------------

**The Road-Map of the experimentation is as follows(Ongoing experiment):**

1. Constructing a basic Convolutional nework from scratch. Link: https://github.com/vishal-burman/Dogs_vs_Cats/tree/master/ConvNet%20from%20Scratch

2. Adding Data-Augmentaion and Dropout techniques to reduce overfitting. Link: https://github.com/vishal-burman/Dogs_vs_Cats-CNN-Experimentation-/tree/master/ConvNet%20with%20DA%20-%20Dropout

3. Training our split-small dataset on a pretrained network. Link:https://github.com/vishal-burman/Dogs_vs_Cats-CNN-Experimentation-/tree/master/ConvNet_Pretrained
